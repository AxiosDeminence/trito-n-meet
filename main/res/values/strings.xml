        "Welcome to Trito(n) Meet created by UCSD students for UCSD Students. Within this app, you "
        "can create a personalized schedule which can include your class schedule, daily routine, "
        "and club events. Best of all, you can also add your classmates' contacts into a group in "
        "order to compare schedules. Trito(n) Meet will find different time slots when everybody "
        "can meet up. \n \n"

        "In order to do so, please create an account with your first name, last name, and UCSD "
        "e-mail and create a password. After registering, you will see an empty home screen. This "
        "is where you can view all of your current and upcoming events on a weekly scale.\n\n"

        "To add an event, press the + button in the bottom right corner. Name the event, set the "
        "start and end times, and set state and end dates. There is an option to set the event as "
        "an one-time event or as a repeating event on a weekly basis. If it is repeating, select "
        "the days on which the event is recurring. Confirm all changes.\n\n"

        "Now that you have added some events to your schedule, you can share it with your "
        "classmates! To share, first form a group by going to the navigation tab on the side "
        "and then GROUPS. You are allowed to create at most five different groups - each with its "
        "own unique name - but you can be a part of as many groups as you like. To add people to "
        "a group, input their UCSD e-mails.\n\n"

        "Additionally, Instead of creating your own group, your classmates can add you to their "
        "own groups. Turn on notifications to receive a message when somebody tries to add you. "
        "To accept the invitation, simply accept it. Otherwise, please press decline.\n\n"

        "Thank you for downloading this app! We hope you will enjoy Trito(n) Meet and use it to "
        "plan hang-outs, group projects, and other events. For more information or to leave "
        "suggestions, please contact tritonmeet@gmail.com.â€œ
