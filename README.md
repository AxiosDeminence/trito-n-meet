# tryto-n-meet

## Description
College students often have difficulties coordinating meeting times between friends and peers to simply hang out or to work on projects together. A large reason why is that class attendance and other extracurricular activities can often be spread throughout the day. Manually parsing a groups' schedules can prove to be difficult and can result in a lot of back-and-forth communication.

We have designed an Android app that helps college students manage their schedules and coordinate with groups of people faster. The app connects to a Postgresql database through a RESTful API to recommend the users an optimal time to meet up given that all members are users, all members are in the same meeting group, and a certain meeting length is specified. We believe that this web app is extremely useful for coordinating hectic schedules of college students and others.

This app and API were designed within just a few weeks as an IEEE Quarterly Project for Fall 2019. As such, only a few base functionalities were able to be created including basic app usage.

## Disclaimer
This project is no longer being maintained. While there are thoughts of recreating the app since it does provide some usage, it will likely feature a Django backend for better user registration and authorization and be a React web-app.
